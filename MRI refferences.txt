LTTP: Long-Term Pavement Performance

shrp: Strategic Highway Research Program

MERRA: The Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) was undertaken by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation
Office with two primary objectives: to place observations from NASA’s Earth Observing System satellites
into a climate context and to improve upon the hydrologic cycle represented in earlier generations of reanalyses

Real_Hum_AVG: Average relative humidity

Freeze-thaw: weathering is a process of erosion that happens in cold areas where ice forms.
A crack in a rock can fill with water which then freezes as the temperature drops. As the ice expands, it pushes the crack apart, making it larger

AADTT_VEH_CLASS_9_TREND: Annual estimate of class 9 trucks in LTPP lane

ANNUAL_ESAL_TREND: Annual estimated Equivalent Single Axle Load for class 4-13 trucks in LTPP lane

Delelt the data that is before 1989 form all excle file
cause the data of trageting variable is starting from the 1989
Convert the excel file and their pages to CSV file 
Read the data set using pandas data frame 
check the sum of null value
change the column name 'STATE_CODE_EXP' with "location"
Reorder the columns with 'DATE' and 'LOCATION' first
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
perform these task on dataset
1- now on each data set, breakdown the data into (date & location) cause this is going to be our reference for the MRI Value and other targets in each table

2- make some visualization for the data in reference to date & location so we can understand the distribution 

3- note that: there is no redundant values, each record is uniqe
4- find the correlation matrix for each data set
